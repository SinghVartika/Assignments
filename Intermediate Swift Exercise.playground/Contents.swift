/*Write a function called siftBeans(fromGroceryList:) that takes a grocery list (as an array of strings) and “sifts out” the beans from the other groceries. The function should take one argument that has a parameter name called list, and it should return a named tuple of the type (beans: [String], otherGroceries: [String]).

Hint:

Here is an example of how you should be able to call your function and what the result should be:

let result = siftBeans(fromGroceryList: ["green beans",

                                         "milk",

                                         "black beans",

                                         "pinto beans",

                                         "apples"])

 

result.beans == ["green beans", "black beans", "pinto beans"] // true

result.otherGroceries == ["milk", "apples"] // true” */
